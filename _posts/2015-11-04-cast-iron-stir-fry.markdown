### For the sauce:

- 2 Tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 Tbsp mirin
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 Tbsp agave nectar

### For everything else:

- 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 14 oz tofu, cubed or cut into tiny triangles (press it if you have the time; otherwise, just blot with a paper towel to remove moisture)
- 3/4 tsp salt
- Several pinches of freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lb broccoli, cut into florets, stems sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1 small red onion, sliced into half-moons
- 1 bell pepper (red, yellow, or orange) sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp minced fresh ginger
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- Cooked <s>quinoa or</s> brown rice, for serving

### For the garnish:
- 1 avocado, pitted, peeled and diced
- 1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts
- 2 big handfuls fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade (or thinly sliced)


Preheat a cast iron pan over high heat. Mix together all the sauce ingredients and set aside.

Have at the ready a baking pan or large bowl to hold the ingredients as they finish cooking. I like to use a 9x13-inch pan so that there's plenty of room and things aren't siting on top of each other and steaming. 

Once the cast iron pan is good and hot, apply 2 teaspoons of the oil. Add the cubed tofu and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and some black pepper. The ingredients shoudl immediately sizzle when they hit the pan; otherwise, turn the heat up. Cook for about 7 minutes, tossing often and spraying with oil as necessary, until the tofu is nicely browned. Not all sides have to be evenly browned; just as long as a few of them are, you're good to go.

Transfer the tofu to the baking pan or bowl and proceed with the broccoli. Apply 2 teaspoons of the oil, toss in the broccoli, and add 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and some black pepper. Cook until the broccoli is charred and bright green, about 5 minutes. Cover the pan between tosses so that it cooks faster. Transfer to the pan with the tofu.

Now proceed with the onion and bell pepper. Apply the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and toss in the onion and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and some black pepper. Cook for about 3 minutes; they should be charred but still crisp. Transfer to the pan with the tofu. Now we'll finish it off with the sauce.

Add the garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes to the cast-iron pan and saute until fragrant (about 1 minute) being careful not to burn (add more oil if necessary). Add the sauce and mix together until heated through and bubbly, about 2 minutes.

Add back all the veggies and the tofu and toss to coat. Taste for seasoning.

Serve over <s>quinoa or</s> brown rice, top with the avocado, peanuts, and basil, and serve hot.
