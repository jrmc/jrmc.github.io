This is my small-but-growing collection of links to pieces of writing that explain things better than I can (and usually with more patience than I can muster). 

## Community dynamics

[The missing stair.](http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html) How predators persist in communities.

[Five Geek Social Fallacies](http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html) Why groups of geeks are prone to particular patterns of dysfunction. This article spawned a number of offshoots; definitely check out [Geek Social Fallacies of Sex](http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/02/geek-social-fallacies-of-sex.html) and [Geek Relationship Fallacies](http://captainawkward.com/2012/04/16/geek-relationship-fallacies/).

[Derailing: How not to talk to people who are telling you something sad.](http://captainawkward.com/2011/12/05/derailing-how-not-to-talk-to-people-who-are-telling-you-something-sad/) Captain Awkward's take on derailing in interpersonal contexts not necessarily related to social justice. (Includes links to good articles on derailing within a social-justice context)

[The Do's and Dont's of Being a Good Ally](http://theangryblackwoman.com/2009/10/01/the-dos-and-donts-of-being-a-good-ally/) Required reading from Karnythia.

## Race, racism, white supremacy

[White Fragility](http://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/view/249/116) Full text of an article from the International Journal of Critical Pedagogy. Fancy!

[Yes, you're a racist... and a traitor](https://medium.com/@thejohnprice/yes-you-re-a-racist-and-a-traitor-6c4bb12c5b63) A folklorist calling about eight kinds of bullshit on the flying of the Confederate flag. 

## Sex, gender, feminism

[Bisexuality does not reinforce the gender binary](http://www.thescavenger.net/sex-gender-sexual-diversity/glb-diversity/467-bisexuality-does-not-reinforce-the-gender-binary-39675.html) -- there's also an [updated, expanded post](http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2012/11/bisexuality-and-binaries-revisited.html) on Julia Serano's blog. (While you're there, might as well read the whole thing; it's all brilliant)

[Judith Butler addressing TERFs](http://theterfs.com/2014/05/01/judith-butler-addresses-terfs-and-the-work-of-sheila-jeffreys-and-janice-raymond/) The theorist who started the conversation on the social construction of gender explains how badly "gender critical" feminists have misinterpreted her work. 

[Nerds and Male Privilege](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2011/11/nerds-and-male-privilege/) Probably a little dated, but spot-on. 

## All About Creepers!
[The C Word](http://captainawkward.com/2012/08/11/the-c-word/) Wherein Captain Awkward fields [reader questions about creepy dudes](http://captainawkward.com/2012/08/07/322-323-my-friend-group-has-a-case-of-the-creepy-dude-how-do-we-clear-that-up/) and, after the comments section explodes, writes this follow-up post to address some of the most common responses. She also links to these other fine works, also directed at men concerned about being called creepers:

[Don't Be A Creeper](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2011/12/dont-be-a-creeper/all/1/) from Dr. NerdLove

[How to not be creepy](http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-not-be-creepy.html) (The Pervocracy)

[An Incomplete Guide to Not Creeping](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/08/09/an-incomplete-guide-to-not-creeping/) (John Scalzi)


## Trans stuff
[Trans 101](https://binarysubverter.wordpress.com/2010/11/24/trans-101/) This is a Trans 101 *for trans people:* "1. You are a person."

[Not Your Mom's Trans 101](http://www.tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/) It's thorough, if a bit... strident.

## Relationships

[Poly Myths](https://www.morethantwo.com/polymyths.html) From *More Than Two* co-author Franklin Veaux. (Also, [Poly Social Fallacies](https://www.morethantwo.com/socialfallacies.html))

[Riding the Relationship Escalator (or not)](http://solopoly.net/2012/11/29/riding-the-relationship-escalator-or-not/) Unpacking a bunch of assumptions we have about relationships, like importance or "seriousness" as a function of time, the eventuality of cohabiting, etc. ([A longer post](http://polysingleish.com/2015/04/28/navigating-non-escalator-relationships/) on this from polysingleish)

## Misc fantastic reads

## And some random resources and other stuff
